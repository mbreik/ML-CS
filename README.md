# ML-CS
This code is an example of using machine learning to detect security threats. It uses a Random Forest Classifier algorithm to classify whether a particular instance is a security threat or not based on the features of the instance.

Note that the code is a very basic example and is not a complete solution for detecting security threats. In practice, more sophisticated algorithms and techniques are needed to effectively detect and prevent security threats.
